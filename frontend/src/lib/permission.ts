/**
 * Frontend permission helpers.
 *
 * The backend is the source of truth for authorization (every endpoint is
 * guarded by `require_permission`); these helpers only drive UX — which nav
 * items to show, which routes a user may enter, and which action buttons are
 * enabled. They are derived from `MeResponse` (`platform_role` +
 * `tenant-scoped roles` + `permissions`), where `permissions` is the aggregated
 * list of currently-effective codes (both `api` units like `customers:read` and
 * `menu` UX codes like `menu:agents`).
 *
 * Never rely on these alone for security — they're a convenience layer that
 * keeps unauthorized UI out of sight. The API will still return 403 if
 * something slips through.
